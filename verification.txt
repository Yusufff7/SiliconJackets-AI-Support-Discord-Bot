we‚Äôre using CircuitSim, right?


[10/7/2023 12:54 PM] nihit_dark_knight
Hi, my name is Nihit. When are we planning to meet ?


[10/8/2023 1:23 AM] sirdankphoenix
Hello everyone! We will release more information after fall break. In the meantime, feel free to note down ideas and look at verilog basics/scripting basics. Thanks!


[10/14/2023 1:23 AM] alexp5251
since we aren't using CircuitSim, I'm a bit lost installing these verilog tools like VCS compiler
how would I go about installing it?


[10/14/2023 12:57 PM] zachellis
If you sign the approriate EULAs for Synopsis then you will be able to access the tools on ECE servers (linlab). During your first meeting the Verifcation leads will go over the steps


[10/16/2023 12:10 PM] zachellis
For those of you who may be in the discord but did not receive an email from the verification leads due to the time you joined the team. They will be having their first subteam meeting this Friday at 5PM in Klaus 2447 @Verification / Emulation

First Steps with UVM Part 1
Doulos co-founder and technical fellow John Aynsley presents a simple, complete SystemVerilog UVM source code example (which you can run on http://www.edaplayground.com/x/Wzp), explaining what is happening and highlighting best practice. You are shown how UVM source code is organized and how to run the example on popular SystemVerilog simulators...

Thank you


[10/22/2023 10:30 PM] tegan2
So are statements within the task block executed sequentially? Like on the first clock posedge, the reset is set low, the very next clock posedge the a, b, and fire are set, then the very next cycle the a,b, and fire are set to 0, then whenever the next posedge of the valid signal the reset_signals task is called?

[10/24/2023 4:25 PM] zachellis
Since you are doing ssh from VSCode it cannot create the xwindow to display the waves. You can install something like FastX or mobaxterm to have both ssh and an xserver on your machine that can display a window


[10/24/2023 4:27 PM] zachellis
You may be able to get it working by installing the xserver on your machine directly and then having vscode use the ssh -X command but that would be more difficult


[10/24/2023 4:33 PM] tegan2
Thanks it shows up through FastX. How can I plot and view signals from here?

[10/24/2023 8:43 PM] additup23
you can select signals you want to see, and add them to a new wave view by right-clicking on them


[10/25/2023 2:18 PM] nikb21
whenever I do "make vcs" it says failed to obtain license. I have access to linlabs so how could I get access to vcs.

@Verification / Emulation I have created a new version of the onboarding project which should be a bit more similar to the structure of our repos and the processes we use to run simulations. If you haven't started onboarding yet or would like to try this new version please clone / pull from the verification onboarding repo https://github.gatech.edu/SiliconJackets/Verification_Onboarding

hi 
I'm working in Decode team and just understood how things are working in matthew-decode branch.
I looked up decode_stage.sv at src/Decode directory, and at the bottom of the file, it looks like these are the outputs of the file.

I looked at decode_tb.sv at sim/Tests and at the bottom of the file, it is checking  the five  outputs which are little bit different from the outputs of decode_stage.sv. 

Is this how I am supposed to verify or is it just a sample code?

[4/4/2024 11:02 AM] 0x6f69
the one sample test certainly does not test every signal the decode stage updates, it only tests that rs1, rs2, and the opcode are correct.
You should extend this to test multiple instruction types (this one test is just R-type). However, signals like reg_write_en or rs1_used will be in the control unit.

When is the verification onboarding project due?


[9/6/2024 10:42 AM] lejackster
Here's the timeline for onboarding:
We'll have our first meeting for new members on 9/16 in Van Leer C241 at our normal meeting time (5-6 PM). We'll tell you how to get access to the required tools to be able to start the onboarding project.
The next week on 9/23 (same room and time), we'll go over the onboarding project and how to write a testbench.
The **due date for the onboarding project will be 9/30** since it shouldn't take too long after we introduce it. After you finish the onboarding project, we'll assign you to verify a module that's part of the CPU being designed.
We'll be sending reminders about upcoming meetings and the onboarding deadline so you won't need to worry about that.

Yup, tomorrow‚Äôs meeting starts at 5 in Van Leer C241. It will be onboarding for new members and we‚Äôll introduce what verification as a team will do, so you won‚Äôt need to prepare anything. Just remember to bring your computer since we‚Äôll be giving you access to the GitHub

We are planning on gathering emails of all the members that don't have access to the server and send them together to ECE Help. If you want to do it yourself to get it resolved faster feel free to do it.


[9/17/2024 5:52 PM] drakowu
Ah I see I see


[9/17/2024 5:52 PM] drakowu

@Verification / Emulation Just a reminder, please try connect to these servers to check if you have access. If you don't send me a DM with your GT email and the problem you encountered. We are sending out the names this Friday to ECE help and hopefully by next Monday meeting everyone have access to the server.
