Hi, hope you guys are enjoying your break! We will sent out an official on-boarding email after the break. In the mean time please feel free to start reviewing some Python / TCL scripting basics and bookmark any online resources that can be useful.


[10/16/2023 5:05 PM] sharkyguo
@Physical Design Please fill out the meeting time survey https://lettucemeet.com/l/Aq43E and join our github team if you have not done so following our previous email.

Thanks everyone for filling out the meeting survey! The most popular meeting appears to be Tuesday 6-7pm. I have booked the room Skiles 271 for the weekly meeting.


[10/17/2023 12:02 PM] sharkyguo
Since this is a last-minute notice, we will not meet in person today. We will reschedule another online meeting time on Friday 5:30pm to 6:30pm for this week only.


[10/17/2023 12:12 PM] sharkyguo
Although we encourage in-person meeting in the upcoming weeks, we will also provide an online link that you can join in case you cannot make it

[10/22/2023 9:53 PM] mhden1
On Q2: "What the average depth, or number of gates, on paths with the least positive slack?"

how do you define the "paths with the least positive slack?"
Shall we get an arbitrary number of paths from the slow corner and calculate on those?


[10/22/2023 10:15 PM] sharkyguo
At the end of the timing report for each path it reports a slack value. You should identify all the path(s) with the least positive slack value and calculate for those

Hi everyone, happy new year! We will forward our semester schedule (or survey) soon, but we don't expect to have a sub-team meeting this week. We are currently making progress on the PDK access and will provide the details once we have settled on a solution.

@Physical Design  Hello SiliconJackets PD members,

Hope the semester is going well so far/you all are staying warm! We wanted to reach out and ask about everyone's meeting availability for the spring semester via LettuceMeet, please fill it out at your earliest convenience. https://lettucemeet.com/l/rWDGG 

Otherwise, we have some PDK news. Due to the timeline we are following, as well as the interesting issues regarding member PDK-access. For the time being we will use the Sky130 PDK and wait for the Cadence enhanced version to come out. Which should be shortly.  We have also met with the Digital Design/RTL team to determine their status and try to put together a roadmap for our eventual tapeout. We will try to go into those topics in more detail at our first meeting!

Thanks and see you soon!

@Physical Design  A quick post on the deliverable for next week
You will be tasked with reading and understanding the essential Innovus scripts for the first parts of the PD process. Please refer to our PD flow github page https://github.gatech.edu/SiliconJackets/Physical-Design-Flow and review the `src/apr` scripts. Start with` top.tcl` and go over all the stage scripts until the end of placement flow. Please also use resources linked on the same page like our previous presentations, official Cadence documentations, or Google to help you understand important commands and steps (what does the command `setDesignMode` do? What is Halo? What are tie hi & lo cells? etc.).

We expect each member to provide at least half-page of notes explaining the important steps of the scripts to show your understanding. Linking those concepts to what we have covered earlier last semester would be very helpful. We are also expecting to have an one-on-one meeting with each of our members for a mid-school year feedback and sync-up. This will help us to hear from you individually about the club / our work and distribute actual design workloads later this semester.

Please dm or email us for an appointment and note submission by next Thursday when we meet. Our availability is posted on the previous LettuceMeet link. Please also don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions, access issues, or time conflicts.

@Physical Design It is also recommended for you to go through the related design stages from this Python-base OpenLane tool (Thanks Taylor). It really helps you to visualize each step of an example PD process (The display commands). https://colab.research.google.com/github/efabless/openlane2/blob/main/notebook.ipynb#scrollTo=8QN38qxmLbjQ

I will post an updated FreePDK45 standard cell library on the Github and synthesis flow soon. We will talk in detail on Thursday.

when looking at the scripts, do we use the Innovus user manuals or DC user manual?

also in a typical PD flow, does CTS come before place and route or after?

I updated the readme, src/apr contains scripts for Innovus, so you should use the documentation for Cadence as listed in the PD file wiki

CTS should be done after placement but before (signal) routing. Consider it has a prioritized routing stage.

Nvidia is coming to GT and holding "office hours" on Feb 15th 2024. The event is supposed to be a casual networking event and they will be raffling off an RTX 4080. You can register here: https://events.nvidia.com/nvgtspring2024

Nvidia said that you should do research/come prepared by going through their career portal/job packet(http://bit.ly/nvur-jd) for teams that fit your skillset and applying in advance (they will not be accepting paper resumes)

What was discussed at last weeks meeting?


[2/8/2024 12:15 AM] mhden1
Is there a file path to the ICC old mmmc file?
Or the name  of the mmmc file used with the ICC flow?
I can't seem to find one.


[2/8/2024 12:26 AM] mhden1
Hmm I think I found where the corners for ICC are defined:
`Physical-Design-Flow/src/syn_new/config.tcl`


[2/8/2024 12:27 AM] auxx
I can't speak to this with absolute certainty, but I believe a dedicated mmmc file is a thing cadence does and not synopsys

[2/8/2024 1:52 AM] mhden1
I made a MCMM file based on Cadence's flow.
slow corner: 0.95V / 125C
fast corner: 1.25V / 0C
typical corner: 1.1V / 25C

However, there was only a `captable `for the typical corner, so I used it for all three corners.
Instead of a `captable`, in a real process we can use the `qrctechfile ` which is more detailed.

I tried to upload my script to the Github repo we have, but I wasn't able. Do we have access rights to upload?

[2/8/2024 11:14 AM] auxx
Might be at both because some synthesis tools do early analysis and would need process corners /mmmc data, I guess at the end of the day hopefully they match

added, you should be able to access the github!


[2/23/2024 12:36 PM] esclown
is there a standard for the rpt file format?


[2/23/2024 6:03 PM] auxx
Just wanted to double check, what did you mean by this:
- Standard format in terms of what you turn in?
- Standard formatting for timing reports themselves?


[2/23/2024 6:05 PM] esclown
standard formstting for the timing reports themselves. ie is there a standardized way to parse the reports if, for example, i wanted to write a library for parsing timing reports and doing analysis


[2/23/2024 6:19 PM] auxx
Sure, the formatting between All EDA tools ive seen is similar to eachother 
- nets are denoted with net in some way with the associated delay value(s) (tool dependent) 
- standard cells/instances (logic) are denoted with a standard cell, input port (A), output port(y), and delay value(s) 
In order the path from clock to some capture flip-flop


[2/23/2024 6:20 PM] auxx
but I think its personal preference on how you parse, I personally typically store the report line by line and do some regex/string operations to find what I want


[2/23/2024 6:24 PM] esclown
got it, thanks. and is 
`report_checks -path_delay max (Setup)`
relevant to the analysis?


[2/23/2024 6:27 PM] auxx
Not for onboarding, but in general yes. Max paths are typically the paths you want to double check, when looking to see if your design meets setup checks, Min paths are the ones you want to look at for hold checks.


[2/23/2024 6:27 PM] auxx
The values will be different etc.. based on some parameters like process,voltage and temperature

On a side note, I have downloaded the Skywater PDK from Cadence and I am in the process of integrating it in my flow (Genus/Innovus/Tempus) to check its performance or any incompatibilities with the CDN tools.

@Physical Design Hello all, we have recently found that students are experiencing intermittent issues with both launching the Cadence tools as well as accessing the ECE linux servers due to some changes made during spring break (And our room is booked). We have submitted a couple IT tickets, but are opting to skip this weeks meeting as it may be hard to work on deliverables until these issues are resolved. Feel free to attempt to work on your tasking via the linux servers (but there is a chance it may not work) or an online TCL IDE like replit.com. Otherwise per-usual @Shaun Guo and I will be available online if you have any questions.

@Physical Design as you know one of our leads @Shaun Guo has graduated and we are looking for a new lead for our upcoming tapeout. Please reach out if you are interested in being a lead starting this semester.

Similarly I am graduating this semester, so we are also looking for someone who would be interested in being a lead the following spring semester. 

For this semester, as it is the tapeout cycle we would prefer someone with tapeout and/or more in depth PD experience, but for those starting the Spring any experience level is welcome.

Yeah I think you'll have to add me (pmathews30). No rush, the help is greatly appreciated

@Physical Design New Members, do you have a preference between tomorrows meeting being a brief introduction an coverage of the onboarding project (:1_DG: ) or should it be that AND a short introduction to EDA and the chip design process (:2_DG: )

Also, I think it would be easier to do the introductory meeting online, as it will be hard to present and record without a projector/screen in klaus 1448


[9/11/2024 9:55 PM] auxx
so I think we will go for online, apologies for the last minute change

The main action items for new members is to complete the onboarding by 9/27 and read through our script repositories if possible

Meeting Time looks like it will be Mondays:  ~~6-7 PM~~
Edit: Shifted to 6:30-8pm due to classroom availability


[9/12/2024 9:09 PM] ryuuqt
Is it best to stay on physical design if we cannot make the meeting time? I don't think I would be able to attend any Monday meetings until ~late October.


[9/13/2024 3:43 PM] auxx
Thats perfectly fine, but I would ask if self-teaching/asynchronous work and communication works well for your work/learning style to make sure you get the most benefit


[9/14/2024 7:49 PM] wehaveagod2005
Where are the details for the onboarding task?


[9/14/2024 7:50 PM] akoul180
It‚Äôs listed in the onboarding GitHub

am i misunderstanding something or do none of the slacks have negative values?


[9/15/2024 3:14 PM] numinal
do we have to look through both rpt files?


[9/15/2024 4:55 PM] auxx
perhaps :hmm:


[9/15/2024 4:55 PM] auxx
either works, but multi should is the intended one


[9/15/2024 4:55 PM] auxx
one is a synopsys report from 4804, the other one I believe is a timing report that comes from the openlane tool


[9/15/2024 4:55 PM] numinal
im confused lol cause it says to usemulti_corner_sta


[9/15/2024 4:55 PM] numinal

[9/15/2024 4:55 PM] numinal

@Physical Design Welcome or new lead for this semester @Aman Koul to the team @Josh Perez will also be a lead this following spring, In interest of giving you all some time to do the onboarding, managing room scheduling conflicts, and giving us some time to prep for upcoming work.

The first full meeting will be on 9/23/24 6:30pm-7:30pm in Klaus 1448,  then weekly at that same time on Mondays in Van Leer E341 (apart from days the room was pre-booked, we will keep you posted) 

This first meeting will be a work/Q&A session regarding the onboarding project. Once again the Onboarding Project is due on Friday the 27th.
